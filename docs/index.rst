The :py:mod:`indico_sixpay` adds an EPayment option for
the *SIX Payment Services* provider
to the *Indico* event management system.

Overview
--------

If the plugin is enabled, event participants can select the ``SixPay`` payment method during the EPayment checkout.
Payment is performed via the **Saferpay Payment Page**, an external service provided by *SIX Payment Services*.
The plugin handles the user interaction inside Indico, and the secure, asynchronous transaction with SIX Payment Services.

The plugin must be installed for an entire Indico instance.
It can be enabled and configured for the entire instance and per individual event.
Note that a valid account with *SIX Payment Services* is required to receive payments.

The plugin follows the
`Saferpay Payment Page <https://www.six-payment-services.com/dam/classic/saferpay/Saferpay_Payment_Page_EN.pdf>`_
specification version ``5.1``.

*This plugin supports Indico 2.0.*
*The legacy plugin for Indico 1.2 is hosted on* `github <https://github.com/maxfischer2781/indico_sixpay/tree/indico-1.2>`_.

Quick Guide
-----------

To enable the plugin, it must be installed for the python version running ``indico``.

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install indico_sixpay

Once installed, it can be enabled in the administrator and event settings.
Configuration uses the same options for global defaults and event specific overrides.

Usage Notes
-----------

The plugin relies on the ISO 4217 standard for currency conversions.
Since they are not properly covered by the standard, the currencies ``MGA`` and ``MRU`` cannot be used for payments.
